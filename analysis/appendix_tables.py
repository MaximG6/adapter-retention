"""Generate Appendix B's tables directly from raw records.

Every number in the appendix is emitted by this script from `results/raw/**`, so the
appendix cannot drift from the data. Transcribing tables by hand is how a raw count and
an audit-corrected count ended up in the same table earlier in this project; this removes
the opportunity.

The 36-layer run and the 4-layer runs are kept separate rather than pooled: pooling
unpaired records once inverted the convention ordering in this project's own analysis
(EXP-008), and the 36-layer run exists for only one adapter and only one scheme.
