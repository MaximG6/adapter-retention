"""Tests for the forward-claim gate.

`retracted.py` closes propagation failure on retraction. This closes it on **addition**,
and the two are structurally different: a retraction leaves a wording behind to search
for, an addition leaves nothing at all. The round that named partial propagation, built
`retracted.py` for it, and wrote the METHODOLOGY entry about it then committed the
addition variant in the same commits -- `[+4.2, +12.5]` reached the abstract, the
introduction, Figure 1's caption and the Conclusion while §5.1, the section whose whole
subject is that contrast, never stated it.

The gate is therefore fed the tree exactly as it stood at that commit, not a synthetic
approximation of it, and is required to name the interval at all four sites.
