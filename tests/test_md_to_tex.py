"""Tests for the markdown-to-LaTeX converter and the overfull-box gate.

Both exist because a defect shipped: 15 of 25 appendix tables overran their column in
the built arXiv PDF, and 10 wrapped so narrowly they rendered one word per line. The
second kind never warns -- TeX wraps silently -- so the converter has to get the width
right rather than rely on the log.

The gate gets the same treatment the instrument gate does (methodological lessons,
"a validation gate must itself be tested against something already known to be broken"):
it is fed a log that must fail and a log that must pass. During development its regex
matched nothing and it reported a clean build over 150 real overfull boxes.
