"""requirements.txt must cover every third-party module the repository imports.

Appendix D tells a reader that `torch` from the CUDA-matched index plus this file is the
whole install. That claim has now been wrong twice. The first time, matplotlib, markdown
and pypdf were missing and every figure script and both PDF builds failed on import; a
comment was added to requirements.txt saying so. The second time, `pymupdf` was missing
and `analysis/texcheck.py` and `analysis/pagecost.py` failed -- found only when a fresh
clone was checked against the file rather than the file being read.

Both survived because the imports are lazy: `import fitz` sits inside the function that
needs it, so every module imports cleanly and the absence surfaces only when the gate
runs, in an environment that already had the package. A note in a file is not a check
(M.3, M.5), so this is the check.

It is deliberately static. Asking whether a package is *installed* would test this
machine; asking whether it is *declared* tests the claim Appendix D makes.
