"""Tests for the cross-reference checker.

Section C.5 of the manuscript records a cross-reference checker that reported nine false
positives: its pattern required whitespace after the section number, and every heading in
the paper uses a period. A checker that is confidently wrong is worse than none, because
its author learns to discount it.

So this one is required to distinguish a reference known to be broken from one known to
be good, in both directions, and the period case is pinned explicitly.
